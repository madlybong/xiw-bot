# Contributing to XIW-BOT

Thank you for your interest in contributing to XIW-BOT. We welcome community involvement, but please note that this is a **volunteer-maintained open-source project** with strict scope limitations.

## 🚫 Scope & Limitations

-   **No Roadmap Commitments**: We do not guarantee the implementation of requested features.
-   **No Support Obligations**: We do not provide specialized support or troubleshooting for varied environments.
-   **Maintainer Discretion**: We reserve the right to reject Pull Requests that increase maintenance burden, introduce complexity, or deviate from the core "operations console" philosophy.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
-   Ensure the bug is reproducible in the latest version.
-   Check existing Issues to avoid duplicates.
-   Provide clear steps to reproduce, environment details, and logs.
-   **Do NOT report "I got banned" as a bug.** This is an inherent risk of the platform.

### Feature Requests
-   We prefer **focused, small-scope** improvements over massive feature requests.
-   Feature requests that involve "ban evasion techniques" or "bulk spamming tools" will be summarily closed.

### Pull Requests
1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  Create a **feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`).
3.  Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages.
4.  **Test locally** (`bun run dev`).
5.  Push to your fork and submit a Pull Request.

## ⚖️ Legal & CLA

By submitting a Pull Request, you agree to license your contribution under the project's **MIT License**. No additional Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is required.

## 🤝 Code of Conduct
